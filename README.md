# C_Training
This is a project for practice - only using for internal  
------------------------------- TRAINING ---------------------------------------

# V1.0
    - Using for Create basic of Enum, Structure, Union
    - Create a simple structure software - Follow the Caro Project
    - Marco, Git comment, Cmake Define, Json Basic
    - Note :
            "add_executable" using for compile source code
            "Json" learning from the visual studio
            ".gitignore" for ignore file - which file was not updated on remote

        + Compile ( expend the syntax and translate to the assembly (low-level language) )
        + Assembly ( change code file to the 0 and 1 and create a obj file .o for linking  )
        + Linking ( link the .o file with each others)
# V1.1
